# DTA__Reviews

This repository contains datasets related to Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews used in our study on machine learning applications for automated literature screening.

## Repository Structure

- **All_Studies/**  
  Contains the full list of studies retrieved during the initial search phase for each DTA review.

- **Relevant_Studies/**  
  Includes expert-labeled relevant studies used as the gold standard for classification.

- **Reviews_Abstracts/**  
  Provides abstracts and metadata for studies included in each review topic.

## Purpose

The data in this repository were used to evaluate and compare the performance of traditional machine learning models and generative AI (ChatGPT) for automating literature screening in DTA reviews.
